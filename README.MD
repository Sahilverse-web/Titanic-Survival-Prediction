  Titanic Survival Prediction

This is a project I made for my Data Science Internship at Codsoft.
This project uses the Titanic dataset to build machine learning models that predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not, based on features like age, sex, passenger class, fare, and more.

 Dataset

The dataset is given as 'Titanic-Dataset.csv'
Machine Learning Pipeline

Data Preprocessing
- Drop irrelevant columns
- Handle missing values 
- Encode categorical variables 
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`

Model Training
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree 
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBOOST

Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

Visualizations
- Confusion matrix heatmap for all models
- ROC curve

Results

- Decision Tree Accuracy: ~80% (lowest)
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~90%
